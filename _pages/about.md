   I am Guillaume Barnier, a Ph.D candidate in the Stanford Exploration Project (<a href="https://sep.sites.stanford.edu">SEP</a>) group, within the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University.
   <br>
   <br>
   Under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Biondo_Biondi">Biondo Biondi</a>, I design new
   <br>
   <b>seismic imaging algorithms</b> to produce accurate maps the Earth's subsurface using sound waves.
   <br />
   <br />
   In 2019, my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ettore-biondi/">Ettore Biondi</a> and I won the award for <a href="https://sep.sites.stanford.edu/guillaume-barnier-receives-award-best-student-paper-presented-seg-2019-annual-meeting"><b>Best Student Paper</b></a> Presented at <a href="https://seg.org">SEG</a> 2019 Annual Meeting for our work on <a href="https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/segam2019-3216866.1">seismic velocity model building</a>.
   <br />
   <br />
   In the last couple of years, I also became passionate about machine learning, especially <b>reinforcement learning</b> algorithms. At Stanford, I recently took the three following amazing classes: reinforcement learning (<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html">CS 234</a>), deep learning (<a href="https://cs230.stanford.edu">CS 230</a>), and machine learning (<a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu"> CS 229</a>).
   <br />
   <br />   
   Before joining the Ph.D program at Stanford, I had the pleasure to work on my MSc from the <a href="https://geophysics.mines.edu">Geophysics Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.mines.edu">Colorado School of Mines</a> where I worked on using seismoelectric waves (electromagnetic waves induced by sound waves) to characterize petrophysical properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs (check out my <a href="https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/79570/Barnier_mines_0052N_10305.pdf?sequence=1"> thesis</a>).
   <br />
   <br />   
   Prior to my Geophysics career, I was an investement banker and I worked for J.P. Morgan Global Markets in London from 2007 to 2010, selling and buying interest rate derivative products for hedge funds.
   <br />
   <br />
   In my free time, I enjoy trail running, riding my bike, and bascially anything that allows me to stay active! Surfing and traveling have always been an important part of my life, and allowed me to spend time in some amazing countries such as Indonesia, Morocco, Peru, Australia, and Mexico.
   <br />
   <br />
   And if you are wondering, I took that picture on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escadaria_Selarón"> Escadaria Selarón</a> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
