<h2>My skills in 5 points...</h2>

<h4>1. Capacity to adapt and perform</h4>

<p class="paragraph-wide">
Throughout my diverse professional life, I proved my ability to quickly adapt and succeed in various and new challenging environements. Here's why:

<ul>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Earned my MSc in Electrical Engineering from Télécom Paris (2007).</li>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Worked in financial markets for J.P. Morgan in London, selling and buying interest-rate derivative products for hedge funds throughout the 2008 financial crisis (2007-2010).</li>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Obtained a scholarship to pursue a thesis-based MSc in Geophysics from the Colorado School of Mines (2011-2013), where I maintained a 4.0 GPA.</li>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Was accepted to the Geophysics Ph.D. program at Stanford University (2013).</li>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Won the award for Best Student Paper Presented at SEG 2019 Annual Meeting for my Ph.D. thesis work.</li>
<li class="paragraph-wide">Became an expert in Machine Learning and led a <a href="/ctp-project">Deep Learning project</a> in collaboration with the Stanford School of Medicine focusing on stroke imaging (2020-2021).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>2. Becoming an expert</h4>
<p class="paragraph-wide">
I enjoy tackling new problems with practical applications and putting all my effort into becoming the best I can be to achieve my goals. My detailed-oriented mindset and competitiveness drive me to go in depth on all topics/activities that I focus on. From research problems to trail-running races, I enjoy the training and preparation that may lead to a success.
</p>

<h4>3. Not being scared when it doesn't work</h4>
<p class="paragraph-wide">
From a research perspective, I learned how to deal with uncomfortable and challenging situations where success is not guaranteed. In fact, in research, nothing ever works the first time (unless you are a genius or/and lucky). I believe the key is to (1) accept this fact, and (2) decompose the problem into smaller subproblems, fix them with simple solutions, and gradually increase the complexity of the solutions.
</p>

<h4>4. Being honest with myself</h4>
<p class="paragraph-wide">
This is the only approach to move forward in research (and I guess in life). I am not afraid to admit when I don't know (which occurs very often), and I try to find ways to challenge my ideas and detect all the possible flaws in my reasoning. This approach can be painful but it remains necessary to achieve anything.
</p>

<h4>5. Teamwork is the key</h4>
<p class="paragraph-wide">
Working within an efficient team is an amazing feeling and a very powerful tool. In fact, most of my professional achievements - especially my Ph.D. - could not have been done without teamwork, as I explain <a href="/eg">here</a>.
