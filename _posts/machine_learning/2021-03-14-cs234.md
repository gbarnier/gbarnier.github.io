<h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<h3>The back story</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
In the Spring 2020, I took Stanford's CS 229 class called Machine Learning and immediately became passionate about one of its subdisciplines called Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a family of algorithms designed to solve one of the fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which is <b>learning to make good decisions under uncertainty.</b><br/><br/>

In November 2020, I decided to fully commit to RL, and began learning and absorbing everything I could possibly find on the subject. I began by watching and studying the amazing David Silver's lecture series available for free on his <a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/"> website</a> and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0">youtube</a>. Then, I took Stanford's CS 234, a 3-month course offered in the Winter quarter and taught by Professor <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/">Emma Brunksill</a> from the Computer Science (CS) department at Stanford. CS 234 was probably the best class I have seen given at Stanford in terms of teaching, content, and help provided by TAs. <br/><br/>

Along the way, I took plenty of notes (based on both David Silver's and Emma Brunskill's lectures) that I thought I could share. In these notes, I force myself to derive the proof for all the main results that both lecturers do not always have time to conduct during their prespective classes. <br/><br/>
