<p style="font-size: 18px">
On my free time, I am currently working on understanding and reproducing the two following articles:

<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 18px"><a class="ref" href="/papers/dreamer1.pdf" style="font-weight: normal" target="_blank">Dream to Control: Learning Behaviors by Latent Imagination</a> (Hafner et. al, 2020)</li>
    <li style="font-size: 18px"><a class="ref" href="/papers/dreamer2.pdf" style="font-weight: normal" target="_blank">Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models</a> (Hafner et. al, 2020)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px">
My goal is to try to master these two papers and then come-up with some new research ideas (and learn a lot of stuff throughout the process).<br/>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px ; font-size: 60px">
Work in progress...<br/> come back in a few weeks!ðŸ˜…
