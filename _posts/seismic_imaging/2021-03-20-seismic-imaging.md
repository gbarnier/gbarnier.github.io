<h3>Seismic imaging: a 3-step process</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">

Similar to sonar, seismic imaging (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology" target="_blank">reflection seismology</a>) is a high-resolution non-invasive technique in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave" target="_blank">seismic waves</a> - more commonly known as sound waves - are employed to produce accurate maps of the subsurface. When such waves propagate through the ground, they interact with the internal structure of the Earth and allow us to identify and localize features of various scales such as the core-mantle boundary location, giant meteor craters, earthquake source locations, and geologic traps for hydrocarbon reservoirs.<br/><br/>

For the past 50 years, seismic imaging has been the most exploited and effective method for hyrdocarbon exploration. Energy companies rely on having good-quality seismic images to ensure safety and efficiency during the drilling and production process.<br/><br/>

However, this task can be quite challenging to achieve in certain parts of the world where complex geological settings are encountered. Therefore, companies have invested considerable amount of resources in research and development to design cutting-edge imaging algorithms aimed at improving our knowledge of the subsurface. This is in fact the <b>main motivation of my thesis work!</b> But examining the more advanced algorithms, let's try to understand the standard approach.<br/><br/>

The conventional seismic imaging workflow conducted by energy companies to assess the structure of the Earth (and potentially identify hydrocarbon resources) is composed of three main steps, as listed below. However, current methods present some limitations that I try to address in my thesis. Click on any of the links (or the icons on the figures above) to learn more about each one of them.

<!-- <h5>Seismic data acquistion</h5>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">
Seismic data must first be acquired on the field by conducting a <a href="http://geologylearn.blogspot.com/2015/06/marine-and-land-seismic-aquisition.html" target="_blank">seismic survey</a>, in which seismic waves are generated by controlled active sources and propagated into the ground. When these waves encounter an interface between two different rock layers (i.e., an abrupt change of rock properties), part of their energy is reflected back to the surface, and recorded by a array of sensors. These recordings are referred to as seismograms and are similar to the ones measured by seismic stations that monitor earthquakes.<br/><br/>

For land (onshore) acquisitions, seismic signals are generated with vibroseis trucks or dynamite explosions, and are recorded by geophones.

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">
Marine (offshore) seismic surveys use airguns sources deployed behind the seismic vessel, and the signal is recorded by an array of hydrophones towed by the ship. <br/><br/>

<h5>Velocity model estimation: the main bottleneck</h5>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">
Seismic velocity estimation (also referred to as seismic velocity model building or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_tomography" target="_blank">tomography</a>), is the main bottleneck of the imaging process and the <b>focus of my dissertation work</b>. It is the estimation of the speed at which the waves travel through the ground, referred to as a seismic velocity model. This speed highly depends on the type of rocks in which waves propagate, and typically ranges from 1.5 km/s for water to 7 km/s for volcanic rocks (compared to 0.3 km/s in the air). <br/><br/>

Tomographic algorithms

The area within the subsurface to be characeterized is first spatially discretized into a 3D array of voxels, and stored on a computer. The value of each voxel represents the speed of sound at a given location, and must be numerically estimated. It turns out that this velocity estimation steps presents three main difficulties:

<ol type = "1" style="margin-left: 0.0em">
<li style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">The number of unknown parameters to recover is very large. For instance, a survey area with a horizontal extent of 10 km x 10 km with a maximum depth of 5 km discretized with a spatial sampling of 10 m (which is quite commmon for industry standards) requires the estimation of as many as 500m parameters.</li><br/>

<li style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">Tomographic algorithms require the use of iterative numerical methods based on minimizing a loss function with gradient-descent optimization schemes. At each iteration, thousands of wave propagations must be simulated on a computer, usually by numerically solving a wave-equation partial differential equation (PDE). This requirement, combined with the high-dimension nature of the problem make these algorithms very computationally intensive, even with the use of general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). Finally, the computational cost is such that a thorough hyperparameter search is practically untractable, and a lot of effort has been put into reducing the number of adjustable hyperparameters within the velocity estimation process.</li> <br/>

<li style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">The most challenging issue comes from the fact that this task is a mathematically and numerically ill-posed problem. In other words, the quality of the estimated solution is contingent on already having a good initial guess and/or access to a certain type of seismic data which are either too costly - or impossible - to acquire. In fact, if the initial guess is too far from the true solution, most schemes tend to recover non-geologically realistic (and thus non-useful) models. From an optimization standpoint, this phenomenon can be explained by the presence of multiple spurious local minima in the loss function that is being minimized.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">
Nowadays, there exists two main families of algorithms for velocity-model building: migration velocity analysis (MVA) tends to be more robust and less sensitive to the accuracy of the initial model but produces low-resolution results. Alternatively, full waveform inversion (FWI) can recover high-resolution features of the Earth but is strongly affected by inaccurate initial guesses.<br/><br/>

This is where my thesis work comes in</b>: I design a new tomography algorithm that mitigates the main drawbacks inherent to MVA and FWI (that is, the tradeoff between robustness and resolution) by merging them into one mathematically consistent workflow that I call full waveform inversion by model extension (<b>FWIME</b>). Indeed, this method also comes with its own limitations, but the fundamental contribution is that it can recover accurate high-resolution velocity models without the need of good initial guesses.
