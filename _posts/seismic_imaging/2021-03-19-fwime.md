<h3>Full Waveform Inversion by Model Extension (FWIME)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">

This is the official name of my thesis. It sounds fancy, but the concept is quite simple: the goal is to improve the velocity model building process when our initial guess is not good enough for conventional methods to work.<br/><br/>

Here, I give an intuitive description of the the algorithm I created for my Ph.D. thesis, and use a numerical example to illustrate its potential at recovering good solutions regardless of the quality of the initial model.

<h5>Main thesis contributions</h5>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size: 18px">
Nowadays, there exists two main families of algorithms for velocity-model building: migration velocity analysis (MVA) tends to be more robust and less sensitive to the accuracy of the initial model but produces low-resolution results. Alternatively, FWI (as we saw in the previous section) can recover high-resolution features of the Earth but is strongly affected by inaccurate initial guesses.<br/><br/>

In my dissertation work, I design a new loss function formulation which merges a particular MVA technique with FWI into one robust and mathematically consistent workflow. By doing so, my method benefits from the robustness of MVA combined with the accuracy of FWI, while only needing a single adjustable hyperparameter. The loss function is minimized by employing the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/19/2/201/meta" target="_blank">variable projection</a> method which helps mitigating the presence of local minima. I refer to my technique as full waveform inversion by model extension (FWIME). Wihtout diving into the details, the novelty of my technique resides in the mathematical way I merge the two more conventional algorithms. This task had been attempted before but with limited sucess.<br/><br/>

Even though robust, my new loss function design increases the computational cost by at least one order of magnitude compared to more convetional methods. Therefore, I develop an industry-quality and efficient GPU numerical implementation in C++/CUDA for 3D field-data applications, wtich may contain tens of terabytes of data, and billions of unknown parameters to recover. <br/><br/>

The last main contribution is that I successfully apply my method on a deep-water node-acquisition 3D field survey, which is rather rare for graduate/academic work. <br/><br/>

<h5>Numerical example</h5>
In this example, I illustrate the potential of FWIME. The left panel in the figure below shows the sequence of inverted models with the conventional (FWI) method. The right panel shows the same sequence but using my algorithm. Each frame corresponds to the inverted models at a given iteration. Both algorithms begin with the same initial model. However, after approximately 40 iterations, the model seems to stay identical and converges to an inaccurate solution. On the other hand FWIME manages to recover an excellent solution.
