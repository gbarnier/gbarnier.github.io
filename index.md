Welcome to my website! My name is Guillaume Barnier, I am a Ph.D candidate in the <a href="https://sep.sites.stanford.edu">Stanford Exploration Project (SEP) research group</a> within the <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/geophysics"> Department of Geophysics</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>. I focus on developing new algorithms to create accurate maps of the Earth's subsurface using sound waves.
<br>
<br>
I am also passionate about Machine Learning (ML), and more specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL). Check out the two ML projects I am currently working on by clicking on the <a href="https://gbarnier.github.io/ml_projects/">machine learning</a> tab.
