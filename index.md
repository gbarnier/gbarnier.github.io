    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>
        My name is Guillaume, a French Ph.D. candidate in the Stanford Exploration Project (<a href="/sep">SEP</a>) research group within the Department of <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/geophysics">Geophysics</a> at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>
    My thesis work is about developing new seismic imaging <a href="/geophysics">algorithms</a> to create accurate maps of the Earth's subsurface using sound waves.
    </p>    
    <p>
    I am also passionate about machine learning (especially reinforcement learning algorithms), scientific computing, numerical modeling, GPU programming, and applied mathematics. Above all that, I enjoy the excitement of tackling challenging scientific research problems.
